## How to contribute
This was adapted from the Ruby on Rails repo -- thanks for the inspiration!

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](../../issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](../../issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Create a test case that shows the bug

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the test case as well as the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number or discussion reference if applicable.

* Use ReSharper or SonarLint for static analysis and make sure that the code has no findings. 

* Ensure that the code has an overall code coverage of at least 98%.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* [Open a new idea](../../discussions/new?category=ideas) to suggest your change. This allows discussion to happen before a pull request comes in, potentially reducing rework. You can of course start writing code in parallel.

* Don't write production code unless you have at least one failing unit test.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* [Open a new Q&A](../../discussions/new?category=q-a).

Thanks for your particapation!
