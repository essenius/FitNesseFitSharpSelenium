This driver switching does not work with Internet Explorer if ran in parallel on the same machine with other browsers.
Apparently that driver has not been written with co-existence in mind

First open a couple of driver sessions

|Script                    |!-SeleniumFixture.Selenium-!                                 |

|open                      |!-http://www.google.com?hl=en-!                              |
|wait until title matches  |Google                                                       |
|Click element             |$acceptCookieButtonGoogle|if visible                         |
|show                      |screenshot                                                   |


Do a Bing search on the Chrome driver

!|script                                                          |
|set driver              |$chrome                                 |
|open                    |http://www.bing.com                     |
|wait until title matches|Bing                                    |
|Click element if visible|$acceptCookieButtonBing                 |
|Click element           |name:q                                  |
|send keys               |Test Automation{ENTER}|to element|name:q|
|wait until title matches|^(?i)(Test Automation)                  |
|show                    |screenshot                              |
|wait for element        |id:b_tween                              |

Do a Google search on the Firefox driver

!|script                                                             |
|set driver              |$firefox                                   |
|open                    |http://www.google.nl                       |
|wait until title matches|Google                                     |
|Click element           |$acceptCookieButtonGoogle|if visible       |

|wait for element        |$resultStatsGoogle                         |

Do a Yahoo search on the remote driver

!|script                                                   |
|set driver              |$remote                          |

|wait until title matches|Yahoo                            |
|click element if visible|$acceptCookieButtonYahoo         |
|send keys               |FitNesse{Enter}|to element|name:p|
|wait until title matches|(?i)(FitNesse)                   |
|show                    |screenshot                       |
|close                                                     |

We already opened up Google on Headless. Also do a search here but search for something different than with Chrome so the screenshot is clearly different.

!|script                                           |
|set driver              |$headless                |
|send keys               |Cheese{ENTER}|to element|name:q|
|wait until title matches|^(?i)(Cheese)            |
|wait for element        |$resultStatsGoogle       |
|show                    |screenshot               |
|close                                             |

Close Chrome. This shows that it doesn't matter in which order the browsers are closed

!|script              |
|set driver|$chrome   |
|show      |screenshot|
|close                |

Close Firefox

!|script              |
|set driver|$firefox  |
|show      |screenshot|
|close                |
