This driver switching does not work with Internet Explorer if ran in parallel on the same machine with other browsers.
Apparently that driver has not been written with co-existence in mind

First open a couple of driver sessions

|Script     |!-SeleniumFixture.Selenium-!                                   |
|$chrome=   |new browser       |Chrome                                      |
|$firefox=  |new browser       |Firefox                                     |
|$remote=   |new remote browser|Chrome         |at address|${SeleniumServer}|
|$headless= |new remote browser|Chrome Headless|at address|${SeleniumServer}|
|open       |!-http://www.google.com?hl=en-!                                |

Do a Bing search on the Chrome driver

!|script                                                    |
|set driver              |$chrome                           |
|open                    |http://www.bing.com               |
|send keys               |Test Automation~|to element|name:q|
|wait until title matches|^(?i)(Test Automation)            |
|wait for element        |id:b_tween                        |

Do a Google search on the Firefox driver

!|script                                                    |
|set driver              |$firefox                          |
|open                    |http://www.google.nl              |
|send keys               |Test Automation~|to element|name:q|
|wait until title matches|^(?i)(Test Automation)            |
|wait for element        |id:resultStats                    |

Do a Yahoo search on the remote driver

!|script                                             |
|set driver              |$remote                    |
|open                    |https://search.yahoo.com   |
|click element if visible|ClassName:primary          |
|send keys               |FitNesse~|to element|name:p|
|wait until title matches|(?i)(FitNesse)             |
|show|screenshot                                     |
|close                                               |

We already opened up Google on Headless. Also do a search here but search for something different than with Chrome so the screenshot is clearly different.

!|script                                           |
|set driver              |$headless                |
|send keys               |Cheese~|to element|name:q|
|wait until title matches|^(?i)(Cheese)            |
|wait for element        |id:resultStats           |
|take screenshot to      |Screenshot-headless.jpg  |
|close                                             |

Close Chrome. This shows that it doesn't matter in which order the browsers are closed

!|script              |
|set driver|$chrome   |
|show      |screenshot|
|close                |

Close Firefox

!|script              |
|set driver|$firefox  |
|show      |screenshot|
|close                |
