Non-existing elements return false (not exceptions)

!|script                                                       |
|set timeout|0.5                            |seconds           |
|reject     |wait for element               |NonExistingElement|
|reject     |wait until element is clickable|NonExistingElement|

A wait should also work if the condition is true at the start

!|script                                            |
|ensure     |element is clickable           |button |
|ensure     |wait until element is clickable|button |
|ensure     |wait for element               |button |
|set timeout|1                              |seconds|
