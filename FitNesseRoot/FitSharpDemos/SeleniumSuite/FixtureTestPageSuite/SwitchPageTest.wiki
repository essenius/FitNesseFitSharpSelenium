The main window is open; get its handle so we can switch back to it later

!| script                  |
|$main=|current window name|
|check |page count    |1   |

Open a second page in a new window, select it and check if we are at the right page now

!|script                               |
|open page via |linkWindow|into|window1|
|check         |page count|2           |
|check         |Title     |iFrame 1    |
|element exists|id:iframe2             |

Go back to the main page, and open a third page, but now in a new tab. 

!|script                                     |
|back to main                                |
|open page via|linkTab      |into  |window2  |
|check        |page count   |3               |
|check        |Title        |Test Site       |
|text exists  |Test site for Selenium Fixture|

To move between tabs, we need to do two things: 1) switch the driver to the right window, and 2) make it active in the UI
Number 2 we do via a !-SendKeys-! command, and number 1 in 'back to main'

The order is not important, as long as both are done.

!|script                                     |
|Send Keys|^{TAB}|to element|CssSelector:body|
|back to main                                |
|check    |Title |Selenium Fixture Test Page |

Now we close the two pages we opened and check if that worked

!|script                                          |
|close page   |$window2|expect   |2  |pages left  |
|close page   |$window1|expect   |1  |pages left  |
|select window|$main                              |
|check        |Title   |Selenium Fixture Test Page|

Note: the window switch will fail on Internet Explorer due to the different protected mode settings
