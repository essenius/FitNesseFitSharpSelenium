Reload the page to make it start the asynchronous loading.
We take 1.1 seconds timeout since the load process takes 1 second (hard coded)
After the page changes, the first Fibonacci numbers should show.

TODO: this sometimes fails on Azure websites - Loading doesn't appear after reloading page. Figure out what's going wrong

Reload again, and wait in a different way. We now wait until the page size is larger than a threshold.
If it is larger already, it won't wait.
