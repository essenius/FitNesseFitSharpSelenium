Define the symbols we need in more than one test

!|script                                                             |
|$browser=   |echo|XPath://android.widget.TextView[@text = 'Browser']|
|$calculator=|echo|xpath://*[@text='Calculator']                     |
|$deleteArea=|echo|id:com.android.launcher:id/delete_target_text     |
All tests start on the Apps page. Tap the element twice (the second one is actually a different element with the same id) so we are sure we are on the Apps page and not accidentally on the Widgets page.

!|script                 |
|tap element     |${apps}|
|wait for element|${apps}|
|tap element     |${apps}|
